# Password Generator (Homework 3)

# Description
This repository contains the files for challenge 3 homework for week 3 of UT Bootcamp. This project was purposed to teach us how to use Javascript to store information using variables and create functions to perform tasks using those variables. We did this by creating a random password generator that created a random string or array of different characters based on user input. I suppose this is just a different type of page responsiveness! We also learned how to use methods such as Math.floor and Math.random to perform built in actions like rounding and randomizing elements/arrays.

# How to Use
Use this webpage to generate a random password to use for a secure website! However, since this is just an exercise I wouldn't actuallly use the exact website for personal sites as there could be some risk even though the code itself doesn't store each password it generates. At the least it could be used to give some inspiration or the beginning of a password that a user can add or edit later.
